# Intro

## What is a pin?
A pin is a series of strategically places wedges around the body *supported* by bodyweight. The wedges are the priority and are more important than bodyweight.

## General pin escape system
The single most important goal of pin escapes is to get inside your oponents wedges. Here is a generalized guide to escaping pins, however escapes are situational and the right escape has to be used on the right pin, this only serves as a theoretical outline.

1. Reduce immediate threats
    - Bring limbs back in to reduce vulnerability to submissions
    - Reduce physical discomfort
2. Create space / create Kuzushi
    - Usually through bridging / shrimping
3. Establish first point of inside position
4. Get majority inside position
    - Exploit 1st point of inside position and kuzushi to gain majority inside control, the point where you have more inside control than uke
5. Utilize majority inside position to recover gaurd or escape

## Three types of escapes
1. Escape to gaurd
    - Within BJJ the vast majority of escapes are escapes to gaurd
3. Reversal (sweep)
2. Escape to neutral (escape to disengagement)

## Minimal vs. positive escapes
Escapes have verying degrees of benefits. A minimumal escape is when you technically escape the position but not to any benefit of yourself, for example, a very loose half gaurd that doesnt have any sense of control. Your goal should always be to work towards a positive escape.

# Basic Movements
These movements are essential to learn, properly, and with deliberation.

## Bridging
The key to bridging within the sport of BJJ is not the height of the bridge, its the torque you generated. **Height is not important, do not worry about the height**, it is how much you displace them to the side. 

The key to generating a lot of torque is strong rotational bridges up onto one and opposite shoulder and foot then switching feet to sustain the turn. If you do not switch feet you will cut the bridge short and will not generate as much torque. You will similarily cut your bridge short if you bridge off your head instead of over your shoulder. It is important for this to be an explosive movement, to stop yourself from losing power make sure you are driving with your hips and glutes

When drilling solo you know when you are doing a full bridge when your body is facing the same direction of your head when you started

## Shrimping
Shrimping is the single most important movement pattern in BJJ for escapes and should nto be viewed as merely a warmup. There are two main shrimps; rising and sliding, however the rising shrimp is more important than sliding most of the time.

**Rising shrimp**  
The goal for a good shrimp in general is to minimize mat contact fo the bottom knee 

Foot position matters, similar to bridging, the closer your feet are to your butt, the easier the movement will be

To start, bridge as explained above until on one shoulder and foot (without switching feet), your bottom foot can be on the matt but it should not be load-bearing. Next, send your hips back and at the same time rotate your leg so that your bottom knee points towards the ground
