# Mount Escapes
1. [Bridging Escape](#bridging-escape)
2. [Elbow Escape](#elbow-escape)
   - [Ankle-based](#ankle-based)
   - [Knee-based](#knee-based)

## Bridging Escape
In high level BJJ this escape is rare, however, it is still worthwhile to learn as it works well at the lower 
levels and can be used to set up other escapes.

There are many variants of this technique based on how the opponent is gripping the Every bridging escape variant works 
, but all variants work by blocking uke's ability to block in one direction and rolling them that direction into guard.

In the standard case where the opponent is postured up with hands on your lapel (or similar).
1. 4-finger pocket grip with your far arm and pull down until you see (and feel) then tension line on the front of 
   the sleeve.
2. With your near arm reach for the back of the sleeve (by tricep) and grab the luff in their sleeve. Do not just 
   grab anywhere it is important that you grab the luff to ensure control.
3. Take your foot on the same side as the arm you trapped and trap their foot.  
4. Bridge and roll towards their trapped side (you likely wont get this and will need to [deal with a response](#dealing-with-responses)).

### Dealing with responses
An educated opponent will see this escape coming as soon you isolate the arm and immediately respond to prevent the 
roll. There is a couple ways of doing this:

1. They shift their butt away from rolling direction
   - **Do not bridge, you will effectively be giving them your back**
   - This is the ideal case and can be turned into a positive. [See here](#how-to-really-use-the-bridging-escape)

2. They base out with their free arm in rolling direction
   - You only need to worry here if it crosses your center line and becomes and effective base. [See here](#chaining-together-directions)
   - Otherwise, bridge and roll into guard

3. They shift their body weight away from rolling direction
   - [See here](#they-shift-their-body-weight-away-from-rolling-direction)

   </figure>
</div>


### How to really use the bridging escape - forcing the butt shift
The most high percentage way to use this technique is to use it to bait the butt shift, as it allows you to recover 
guard 
instead of entering their guard. In order to bait the sit out, do the regular technique without trapping the ankle, 
allowing them out to shift their weight and post with their foot. If they do they will create a gap underneath 
their leg that you can insert a knee wedge into. From their lift your shin up and away to create enough space for your 
other knee to wedge in and land in butterfly guard.

### Troubleshooting the bridging escape

#### Dealing with posted arm towards rolling direction
This is an opportunity to isolate the posting arm and switch directions, however we will go about it a different 
way. 

1. Underhook the posting arm right in the elbow groove then clamp down on it keeping it snug to your body
   - Do not let go of the sleeve with your otherhand to prevent them switching their base to their other hand
   - The goal here is to prevent uke from being able to posture up.
2. Grab their back with your right hand
   - Not sure why
3. Roll opposite of the oiriginal direction into guard

  </figure>
</div>
This move can and should be purposely chained together with the standard bridge escape.

#### They shift their body weight away from rolling direction

Do a short bridge towards rolling side just enough so they come back into your center line and grab the back of
the gi with rolling side arm and reach inside the lapel. Use this lapel grip to pull their head towards the rolling side so your head is on the far side of rolling
direction. Trap their arm on rolling side with your elbow. Bridge and roll towards rolling side and take him over

#### Dealing With The Grapevine
Oftentimes when uke has you in mount, they will grapevine to prevent you from being able to bridge. **It is not even
worth attempting the bridge until you clear the grapevine.** Follow the steps [here](#dealing)

## Elbow Escape

> "Incontestably the single most important overall escape in the sport of BJJ. This is the single most high percentage 
escape from any pin position across all belt levels and size differences"

There are two main types of elbow escape:
  - [Ankle-based](#ankle-based)
    - generally better for static situations where the opp. has already mounted you.
  - [Knee-based](#knee-based)
    - generally better for dynamic situations like when the opp. is actively mounting you from side control.

### The common setup:
1. Break their posture
   1. If they are postured up use their knee to off-balance them forward so they put their hands on the mat, the goal
      here is to take the weight off their legs
2. Set your elbow frames up
   1. Use your right arm to create a frame along their help, making
      sure we [dont let our elbow too far in to prevent back exposure](#preventing-the-back-take)
   2. Use your other arm and frame along their knee

---

### Ankle-based: [ADD PHOTOS]
3. Setup position
   - Turn towards your left frame, staying up on foot on right side, and having your leg straight on 
      left side. It is *very* important to keep the left leg as flat to the mat as possible, any sort 
      of elevation will make it harder for you to trap their ankle
4. Trap the ankle
   1. Slide your left knee under their leg until their ankle is on top of your leg and their foot is elevated. 
      It is important to be heavy on your left frame, otherwise you will just keep pushing their leg up 
      rather than sliding underneath.
   2. Use your right leg to hook their elevated foot and wrap a triangle around their ankle
5. Switch your hips
   1. Roll from your left hip over to your right hip. You will likely need to break the triangle and use your left 
      knee to shift their leg over to fully roll 
6. Re-establish frames
   1. Use your arms (left on shoulder, right on bicep) to create a frame against their shoulder.
      - If you do not set up this frame they can easily smash you and flatten you and you have effectively taken a 
      non-dominant half guard over a dominant full guard
7. Shrimp to create space
   1. Plant your left foot against the mat and shrimp to create space for your right knee. 
      - It is important that your right leg is firmly hooking their leg (hamstring engaged) as you shrimp otherwise you 
         are giving them an opportunity to pass into side control
8. Recover guard
   1. Place your right elbow against their knee to prevent them from closing the space you created.
   2. You should have enough space to recover a butterfly with right knee
   3. Straighten your posture so that your body is parallel to theirs, this should provide the space needed to 
      switch from butterfly to full guard
      - If they are extremely tight with the knee and dont provide the space to slide it out then shrimp out one more 
        time to create the space

### Using the ankle-based method
The ankle-based method is best used while the opp. is moving from side control into mount

#### When they knee slide from side control
When the opponent is knee-sliding from side control, open up your hips, turn away from them, and let them slide across. 
This will cause their ankle to naturally fall into the gap leaving it free to be captured and the ankle based method 
may begin.

#### When they step over from side control [TODO]
1. TODO 
2. TODO
3. TODO


### Troubleshooting the ankle-based method
#### If They Tuck Their Feet Below
Can try and push on their feet with your feet to attempt to separate and un-tuck their feet to use ankle-based method 
elbow. However, any good opponent is not going to give you their feet easily. In this situation you should switch to 
using the knee-based method.

----

### Knee-based:
3. Off-center their balance
   1. Force them to post on their hand and knee by bridging (1).
      - This wont be your full-commit bridge as you dont want to cross your feet over so that you can stay in a good 
        position to rising shrimp (2).
4. Switch both hands to their knee
   1. It is considered safe to put two hands on the opponent's knee (2.5) as is a stronger frame and your elbow is 
      tucked away meaning they cannot attack it.
5. Rising shrimp to create space
   1. Head on the outside means they are light on far-side and you can use a rising shrimp to create space.
6. Insert your knee
   1. Close the space by inserting your knee under their leg (3).
7. Recover butterfly guard
   1. Once the first knee is in you can roll to the center to flatten your back which should shift their weight with you (4).
   2. From here you should have enough space to bring other knee and recover butterfly guard.

### Troubleshooting the knee-based method
#### Dealing with strong legs that dont allow room to insert the knee
If the opponent has really strong legs and is able to clamp really tightly to avoid your rising shrimp, shimmy your
leg in instead. To do this, base on the foot you arent trying to shimmy and take shimmy foot off the floor (1). From
here shimmy the leg until you can insert the knee.

### General troubleshooting for elbow escapes
#### Dealing With Opponent Passing Bellybutton Line [TODO]
TODO
#### Preventing The Back Take
The biggest cause for back exposure during the elbow escape is the top frame drifting too far, which will either 
expose the back, or give the opponent the opportunity to start pushing on the frame to drift it further. To prevent 
this try and keep the elbow of the top frame inline with their hip to prevent drift, your elbow should make 90 
degree angle.

#### Dealing With The Cross Face
For the elbow escape the crossface is actually not an issue as long as you try and turn with it instead of into it.
Use the knowledge to pick your direction. The only thing the crossface add si the fact they are likely tight against
your body making it hard to get your frames in. To solve this, put your hands on their hips and hip bump enough so
that you can get frames in, then its business as usual as long as you escape away from crossface

### The foot battle
The foot-battle is an extremely important part of surviving and escaping the bottom mount as it serves as one of 
their main point of connection. 

There are two main options your opponent can use to make your life hell.

#### 1.  The grapevine
In order to clear the grapevine, deal with them one at a time. Pick a side and turn that foot outwards and kick your
foot out. The grapevine should release. Do the same with the other side (or not, the single-sided grapevine is the
same as an ankle trap).

#### 2. Locked feet [TODO]
In order to clear the grapevine, deal with them one at a time. Pick a side and turn that foot outwards and kick your
foot out. The grapevine should release. Do the same with the other side (or not, the single-sided grapevine is the
same as an ankle trap).

If they are too high up use [](#dealing-with-opponent-passing-bellybutton-line)

After unlocking their feet, it is important to switch immediately to the [long-short position]
(#preventing-the-foot-battle-using-the-long-short-position) in order to avoid them relocking

#### Preventing the foot battle using the long-short position [TODO]

prevent it there is nothing stopping them from re-entering the grapevine or locking their feet again
