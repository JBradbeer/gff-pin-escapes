# Side Control Escapes

{:TOC}

Side control is the single most dominant position for control in BJJ from a beginner all the way up to an advanced 
level. 

The first thing to assess when put in an elbow escape is what type of side pin are you in; crossface with underhook, reverse crossface with elbow pinning hip, kesa, etc. Each pin requires its own response.

### Elbow Escape
Elbow escape is the single most reliable and dominant form of side control escapes.

Ideal sequence:
1. Create space for your elbow
2. Insert elbow
3. Bridge to create space
4. Insert knee
5. Take half guard
6. Switch to closed guard

#### Creating space
A fundamental requirement for a side control pin to be effective is that the head and hips of tori need to be on opposite sides of the body, even if they have hands clasped. As escapee, a main goal is to get their head and body to the same side as it will allow you to have an easier time getting your knee in

There are two main ways to displace their head to get to the same side of their body, bicep crossface and forearm crossface.

#### Inserting the knee
The best position to get your knee in is through the opponents hip line with your foot higher than knee. A very common mistake is to bring it in along the ground line, this will lead to you running into their knee or thigh which you will not beat. If you do not have enough space after bridging, keep your knee on their hip line and shrimp repeatedly, your knee should insert with each shrimp. 

Your final position (for insertion) should be your knee touching your elbow creating a v-shape. This is a very strong shape that prevents them from collapsing your frames.

### Troubleshooting the Elbow Escape

#### Dealing with a heavy cross face
A strong crossface will turn your body in the opposite direction you need to move for the elbow escape making it difficult to bridge into them. In order to relieve pressure there are a couple methods for dealing with the crossface.

1. Walk with your feet to rotate you away from their body, this will force them to either follow or maintain the crossface (they cannot do both).   
    - If they follow they will lose the crossface for a moment of time, leaving an opportunity to bridge
    - If they don't follow they leave their hips space open allowing you to change direction and shoot your knee in

2. Bridge the other way instead, underhooking near-side arm in their armpit.
    - If they let you sweep, take it
    - If they base out on far side they will lose their heavy pressure giving you an opportunity to use the regular elbow escape

3. [*John's favourite*] Bicep crossface with farside bicep and bridge, this does not feel good. ([See photo above](#creating-space))

#### When they block your knee insertion with their hand
If they block the knee insertion, shrimp away from uke and take half underhook with farside hand, this should stop them from being able to block effectively and you can slide knee back in.

### Knee Escape [INCOMPLETE]
Also a very strong and reliable escape, as important as elbow escape.

Steps:
1. TODO
2. TODO
3. TODO

#### Getting the underhook
A good opponent will never willingly give you the underhook, it is a battle to get. The knee escape can not work without the underhook.

In order to get the underhook, first start off with a far side forearm crossface, this prevents uke from driving head into you which makes getting the underhook much more difficult. Once you have the crossface, bridge into them, this should create enough space to swim in for the underhook. You will likely get flattened again but this is no problem because you are net ahead with the underhook

#### Beating the crossface
Same as the elbow escape, if uke has a strong crossface you will struggle to turn into them and pull off the escape. In order to beat the crossface, use your underhook like a bicep crossface on the armpit and bridge, shooting your head towards their waist.

#### Kuzure kesa gatame vs traditional kesa gatame
These are the two most popular sit-out (or kesa gatame) positions used. The difference between Kuzure and 
traditional is the underhook vs the head hold. 

Traditional is better for short term pinning like in Judo or Wrestling due to the risk of the back take. However, for 
BJJ where you need to either hold a pin for a longer term or attack a submission, you are most likely to encounter 
**kuzure kesa gatame**.

The strength of any kesa gatame is going to be based on the ability to isolate and lockdown the elbow. *If you can 
get your elbow down to the mat, you will have a much easier time escaping*.

There are two situations here:
- The opponent is transitioning into a sit out
- The opponent has locked in a sit out

### Escaping while the opponent is transitioning
If the opponent is in side control and transitions from a crossface to grabbing your elbow, it is a dead giveaway 
that they are looking to switch to some form of kesa. Your instinct when this happens should be to immediatly get 
your elbow to the mat as quickly as possible

**Steps to escape:**
1. Recognizing its happening
   1. If you
2. Get your elbow down to the mat
3. Cross face
4. Shrimp until you have space to insert the knee
